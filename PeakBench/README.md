# PeaKBench

    
Benchmarking is an essential suite supporting development of database management systems. It runs 
a set of well defined data and workloads on a specific hardware configuration to gather the results
to fill the measurements. It is used widely for evaluating new technology or comparing different 
systems so as to promote the progress of database systems. 

PeakBench is a new benchmarking tool, which puts much more effort for domain specific needs, i.e.,  
workload dynamics, skewness, concurrence control and resource contention for TP businesses. We design 
the tool with full adaptiveness and extensibility for developers and vendors to define their own 
workload characteristics simulating their business. One of the representative applications is 
SecKill (Second Kill) which generates intensive workloads with high dynamics, severe concurrence and 
violent contention.
